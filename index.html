      OPENING TEXT SECTION
      ====================
      This section displays a series of text messages that fade in and out sequentially
      before revealing the envelope. It creates a nice introduction effect.
      
      How it works:
      1. All text elements start hidden (opacity: 0) and positioned slightly below
      2. JavaScript adds the 'active' class to each text one by one
      3. When a text gets the 'active' class, it fades in and slides up smoothly
      4. After all texts are shown, this section fades out and the envelope appears
      
      You can customize the messages by changing the text inside each <h2> tag.
      To add more messages, just add more <div class="text"> elements.
    -->
    <section class="opening-section">
      <!-- Container that centers all text elements -->
      <div class="text-container">
        <!-- First opening message - appears first -->
        <div class="text"><h2>Happy Valentines Day Zhink!</h2></div>
        <!-- Second opening message - appears after the first one fades out -->
        <div class="text"><h2>I Made A Little Something For You</h2></div>
        <!-- Third opening message - appears after the second one fades out -->
        <div class="text"><h2>I Hope You Like It! ^ ^</h2></div>

                        &emsp; I know na medyo random nga yung message na ito and I acknowledge that this is maybe a little over the top  WHWHAWWA, but in this message I just want to say happy valentines day to you and let you know that your presence really lightens up my day and many others aswell :>
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; Your laugh and joyfulness is really contagious and I hope you never lose that beautiful spark within you. Even back when we weren’t that close, I could see that you truly are a kind and caring person which made me really glad that I made the effort to get to know you better!
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>      
                    <span>
                        &emsp; During the times we played Valo with others (i.e Rid, Cheryl, & Zena) or just duo’d together, napapansin tlga ako sa AURA mo WHWAHAWHA napakajoyful tlga mahirap di makisama e. I also really like hearing you yap/talk about random things! There’s something about the way you tell stories or go on little rants that I find funny and genuinely enjoy. So thats why as time moves on I hope I can get to know you better and be able to have more fun memories with you.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I hope you have a wonderful day and that this message brings a smile to your face. Happy Valentines Day Zhink.
